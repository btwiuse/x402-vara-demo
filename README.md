# x402-vara Browser Wallet Payment Template

> üõ†Ô∏è **A starter template for building payment-enabled applications with x402-vara**

This is a simplified scaffolding project demonstrating [x402 payment protocol](https://x402.org) integration with browser wallet support on Vara Network. Use this as a foundation to build your own micropayment-enabled services, SaaS applications, or any project that needs frictionless web payments.

## What is x402?

x402 is a payments protocol for the internet built on HTTP. It enables:
- **1 line of code** to accept digital dollars
- **No fees**, 2 second settlement
- **$0.001 minimum** payments

## What is x402-vara?

x402-vara is an implementation of x402 protocol for Vara Network. The official coinbase/x402 repo contains implementation for major EVM blockchains and Solana. Thanks to the chain-agnostic nature of x402, it is possible to add support for other non-EVM platforms like Vara Network.

Currently x402-vara supports payments via its native currency VARA on mainnet and testnet. USDC/USDT stablecoin support is underway.

## This Template Includes

‚úÖ **Two Payment Models** ready to customize:
- **24-Hour Session** (1.00 VARA): Time-based access perfect for SaaS
- **One-Time Access** (0.10 VARA): Single-use payments for actions or content

‚úÖ **Complete Implementation**:
- Server with x402 payment middleware (express)
- React client with wallet integration (axios)
- Session management and validation
- Clean, modern UI ready to customize

‚úÖ **Developer Friendly**:
- TypeScript throughout
- Easy to extend and modify
- Well-documented code
- Production-ready patterns

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install:all
```

### 2. Configure the Server

Create `server/.env`:
```env
NETWORK=vara-testnet
ADDRESS=kGkLEU3e3XXkJp2WK4eNpVmSab5xUNL9QtmLPh8QfCL2EgotW
PORT=3001
```

### 3. Run Both Server and Client

```bash
bun dev
```

This starts:
- Server on http://localhost:3001
- Client on http://localhost:5173

Open http://localhost:5173 in browser with a compatible wallet installed:
- SubWallet
- Nova Wallet
- Talisman
- ...

## How It Works

### Payment Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**: User connects browser wallet to the app
2. **Choose Payment Type**:
   - **24-Hour Session**: Pay 1.00 VARA to get a session ID valid for 24 hours
   - **One-Time Access**: Pay 0.10 VARA for single-use access (valid for 5 minutes)
3. **Sign Payment**: User signs the payment request
4. **Receive Session ID**: After payment, user gets a session ID
5. **Validate Session**: Use the session ID to access protected resources

### Session Types

#### 24-Hour Session
- **Price**: 1.00 VARA
- **Duration**: 24 hours from purchase
- **Usage**: Unlimited during the valid period
- **Use Case**: Users who need extended access

#### One-Time Access  
- **Price**: 0.10 VARA
- **Duration**: 5 minutes to use
- **Usage**: Single use only
- **Use Case**: Quick one-off actions or trials

## API Endpoints

### Free Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Server health check
- `GET /api/payment-options` - Available payment options
- `GET /api/session/:sessionId` - Validate a session
- `GET /api/sessions` - List active sessions

### Paid Endpoints

- `POST /api/pay/session` - Purchase 24-hour session (1.00 VARA)
- `POST /api/pay/onetime` - Purchase one-time access (0.10 VARA)

## Client Features

1. **Wallet Connection**: Connect/disconnect wallet
2. **Payment Options**: Clear display of both payment types
3. **Session Validation**: Input field to check session validity
4. **Active Sessions**: Display of all active sessions
5. **Real-time Updates**: Session list updates after purchases

## Testing

1. Get Vara Testnet token from [Gear IDEA Faucet](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network)
2. Get USDC/USDT from [Vara Bridge](https://bridge.vara.network/) (optional, not required for this demo app)
3. Connect browser wallet to the app
4. Purchase a session or one-time access
5. Use the session validator to check your session
6. Watch one-time sessions expire after use

## Use This Template For

This scaffolding is perfect as a starting point for:

- **SaaS Applications**: Implement day passes, premium features, or usage-based billing
- **Content Platforms**: Charge for articles, videos, or exclusive content
- **API Services**: Monetize your API with per-call or time-based pricing
- **Digital Tools**: Add trial periods or one-time purchase options
- **Gaming**: Implement in-game purchases or pay-to-play mechanics
- **Any Web Service**: If you can imagine it, you can charge for it with x402

## Customization Guide

### Changing Payment Models

The template uses two payment types, but you can easily modify them:

```typescript
// In server/index.ts, customize your payment endpoints:
app.get(
  "/api/pay/hello",
  requirePayment({
    price: {
      amount: "0.10",
      asset: "VARA",
    },
    network,
    ...
  }),
...
```

### Adding New Features

1. **New Payment Tiers**: Add more options in the payment middleware
2. **Different Session Durations**: Modify the expiration logic
3. **Custom Validation**: Extend the session validation system
4. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with your database
5. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and payment history

### Styling and Branding

The UI is intentionally minimal so you can add your own design system. All styles are in `client/src/App.css`.
